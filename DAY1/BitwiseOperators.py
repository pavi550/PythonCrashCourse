#Bitwise Operators
#'''Bitwise operators act on bits and perform the bit-by-bit operations. These are used to operate on binary numbers.
# and = &, not = ~,or = |, Xor = ^, right shift = >>, left shift = << .'''

# Examples of Bitwise operators
a = 10
b = 4

# Print bitwise AND operation
print(a & b)

# Print bitwise OR operation
print(a | b)

# Print bitwise NOT operation
print(~a)

# print bitwise XOR operation
print(a ^ b)

# print bitwise right shift operation
print(a >> 2)

# print bitwise left shift operation
print(a << 2)
